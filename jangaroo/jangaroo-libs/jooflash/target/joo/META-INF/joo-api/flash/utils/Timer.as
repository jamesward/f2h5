 * The Timer class is the interface to timers, which let you run code on
   a specified time sequence. Use the <code>start()</code> method to
   start a timer. Add an event listener for the timer event to set up
   code to be run on the timer interval.
   <p>You can create Timer objects to run once or repeat at specified
   intervals to execute code on a schedule. Depending on the environment
   (available memory and other factors), events may be dispatched at
   slightly offset intervals. Memory-intensive scripts may also offset
   the events.
