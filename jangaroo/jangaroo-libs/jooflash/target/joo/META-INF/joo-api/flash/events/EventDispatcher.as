/**
 * The EventDispatcher class implements the IEventDispatcher interface and is the base class for the DisplayObject
 * class. The EventDispatcher class allows any object on the display list to be an event target and as such, to use the
 * methods of the IEventDispatcher interface.
 * <p>Event targets are an important part of the Flashï¿½ Player event model. The event target serves as the focal point
 * for how events flow through the display list hierarchy. When an event such as a mouse click or a keypress occurs,
 * Flash Player dispatches an event object into the event flow from the root of the display list. The event object then
 * makes its way through the display list until it reaches the event target, at which point it begins its return trip
 * through the display list. This round-trip journey to the event target is conceptually divided into three phases:
 * the capture phase comprises the journey from the root to the last node before the event target's node, the target
 * phase comprises only the event target node, and the bubbling phase comprises any subsequent nodes encountered on the
 * return trip to the root of the display list.
 * <p>In general, the easiest way for a user-defined class to gain event dispatching capabilities is to extend
 * EventDispatcher. If this is impossible (that is, if the class is already extending another class), you can instead
 * implement the IEventDispatcher interface, create an EventDispatcher member, and write simple hooks to route calls
 * into the aggregated EventDispatcher.

   * need to use this constructor. If you are unable to extend the EventDispatcher class and must instead implement the
   * IEventDispatcher interface, use this constructor to aggregate an instance of the EventDispatcher class.
   * @param target (default = null) The target object for events dispatched to the EventDispatcher object.
   *   This parameter is used when the EventDispatcher instance is aggregated by a class that implements
   *   IEventDispatcher; it is necessary so that the containing object can be the target for events. Do not use this
   *   parameter in simple cases in which a class extends EventDispatcher.
